This file is part of The Virginia Tech Amateur Radio Association's AMSAT FOX-1
experiment.

There are two main projects from which this code derives:

ChibiOS/RT 2.4.3
jpegant

ChibiOS/RT is unmodified, and retains its source structure in ./os/

jpegant is modified from its original version, and best efforts are made to
annotate the differences between the released jpegant and the contributions made
by VTARA.
